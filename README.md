# database-triggers-project

We are running an online watch store and need to make sure we have a record of when customer information is modified and to ensure changes match our business rules. We will be looking at a small subset of this database server and examining two tables, customers and customers_log. The information in these tables were randomly generated.

If you have trouble viewing information on any of the panels remember you can adjust the size of any of the windows by dragging on their edges.
